## ðŸ§· Mounting Tips

- Use acrylic rods, nylon thread, or invisible scaffolds to hold components during epoxy pour.
- Degas epoxy before casting to ensure optical clarity.
- Prefer silicone wire with translucent sheathing to blend into the structure.
- If passive bass ports are included, align them with speaker diaphragms before final mold seal.
